# DOCUMENTATION (TRIVIA API)

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the TRIVIA ALX API. This API is a that of the second project of the Full Stack Course presented by ALX in
Nanodege. It is and API which gives access to data in relation with questions classified in different categories.
It gives us the possibility of storing, retrieving and managing question data grouped by thier category.

### API keys / Authentication
This version of the API does not support authentication or API keys.
